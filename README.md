# NumPy-in-Python
This notebook is a comprehensive walkthrough of NumPy (Numerical Python) covering basics to advanced features including array creation, reshaping, operations, statistics, broadcasting, handling missing data, saving/loading, and linear algebra.

---

## ✅ Setup

Explains how to import the NumPy library and prepare your environment.

---

## 🧱 Creating Arrays

Covers methods to create 1D, 2D arrays, arrays of zeros/ones, identity matrices, random numbers, and evenly spaced values.

---

## 🔍 Array Information

Explains how to retrieve shape, dimensions, total elements, data type, and memory size of arrays.

---

## 🔄 Reshaping and Flattening

Details how to reshape arrays, flatten them, transpose, and add new dimensions.

---

## 🔎 Indexing and Slicing

Demonstrates how to access specific elements, rows, columns, and submatrices using slicing.

---

## 🧮 Array Operations

Covers scalar operations, element-wise arithmetic, dot products, and broadcasting.

---

## 📊 Math Functions

Includes operations like sum, mean, median, standard deviation, variance, min/max, argmin/argmax, cumulative operations, rounding, and unique values.

---

## ✅ Logical and Comparison

Illustrates logical comparisons, conditional replacements, and boolean checks like any/all.

---

## 📋 Copying and Broadcasting

Explains how to create deep copies and apply broadcasting across dimensions.

---

## 🚫 Handling Missing Data

Shows how to detect and replace NaN (missing) values in arrays.

---

## 💾 Saving and Loading Arrays

Covers saving NumPy arrays as binary and text files and loading them back.

---

## 🎲 Random Module

Explains how to generate random numbers (normal, integers, uniform), permutations, and use random seeds.

---

## 🧮 Matrix & Linear Algebra (`linalg`)

Introduces matrix operations like inverse, determinant, eigenvalues/eigenvectors, and solving systems of equations.

---

## 🧰 Utility Functions

Describes helpful functions like clipping, sorting, and finding percentiles.

---

## 📉 Full NumPy Analysis with Pandas

Combines NumPy and Pandas to load CSV data, convert it to arrays, perform statistical and correlation analysis, filter rows, normalize data, and summarize metrics.
